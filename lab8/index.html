					<p> Working with a partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The main problem I had was getting my output to show on the console. I kept getting a notice that one of my identifiers had already been declared. After that, I struggled to figure out how to get my output to show on my weboage. I figured it out with the help of ChatGPT! </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p> You can also see the results in the console!</p>

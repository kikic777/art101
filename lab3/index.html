			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The idea of this lab was to create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems that arose were getting used to the different tags we learned about. I was able to slowly figure out how to create different file structures, like index.html. It took a lot of trial and error and reviewing examples. I found it easier to link these file sturctures to other pages.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assingment was straightforward, but it took more effort than I expected. While the information I needed, like the provided file structure, was there I still had trouble getting some things to work right. I enjoyed this lab, because the errors gave me a chance to practice and better understand what I'm learning. </p>

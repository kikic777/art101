					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I had was adding and checking the lines for the fucntion together. I also struggled on Task X. I couldn't get the text on the left appear in color. I had to change the text id in general instead of changing it with the new left id in CSS. I also had trouble getting the text sections to not overlap like text bubbles. I did this by creating a chat box window to limit the amount of space the bubbles would take up and changing the min amount of text that can be generated.</p>

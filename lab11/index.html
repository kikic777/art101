					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The problem I had was getting the output to show. I was able to get the button and input working, but I couldn't get the annagram to show at first. It turned out to be because I put the output div in the wrong place. I couldn't figure out the rest of Task X. I got a glitch affect to work, but couldn't toggle it with a button or set it on a timer. I was able to create more buttons that edit the page and an extra special button. Shout out to ChatGPT!</p>

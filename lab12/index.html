					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that I had was trying to connect my fuction with mod to my array to print both the title and the description. At first, it wasn't printing at all. It turned out to be because of how I was writing the code for newText. I also had trouble adding the links. They appear physically, but do not link to anything. Shout out to chat GPT!</p>
